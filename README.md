# Automobile Management System

The Automobile Management System is a Java program that allows users to manage and manipulate information about automobiles. It provides functionality to add, view, and perform operations on automobiles.

## Features

- Add automobiles to the system with details such as make, model, color, year, and mileage.
- View a list of automobiles stored in the system.
- Perform operations on automobiles, such as calculations or data manipulations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Sondra94534/AutoManagement.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

3. Run the `AutoManagement.java` file.

4. Follow the instructions provided by the program to interact with the system.

## Usage

The program will prompt you to enter the make of a vehicle. Enter a valid make, and the program will display a list of available models for that make. Then, you can proceed to enter the model, color, year, and mileage for the vehicle. The information will be stored in the system.

You can also perform additional operations on the stored automobiles by modifying the code in the `main` method. Examples of operations include calculations based on the stored data or generating reports.
